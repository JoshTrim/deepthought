# Notes

### Requires Python 3.11 - Coqui dependency is not compatible with Python 3.12
### TTS made possible via a forked version of RealtimeTTS - I have removed any reference to the pyttsx3 library, which proved impossible to install on Mac.



### Modes
- Standalone: The main mode, operation occurs entirely on device
- Client: Allows offloading of some/all processing to a secondary device, typically a computer with more processing power.
